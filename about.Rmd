### Research Experience

**Study on Effectiveness of Environmental Protection Policies in Reducing Environmental Pollution Caused by Economic Development**

* Constructed a two-phase panel dataset with data of 55 prefectures in 5 provinces in 2015 and 2018, and used a first-order differential equation to test if environmental protection policies slow down the environmental pollution caused by economic development based on the environmental Kuznets curve.

**Selection of Raw Materials Suppliers for Enterprises** 

* Collected supply data of 402 raw material suppliers for an enterprise in the past 5 years, and used TOPSIS method to figure out the weight for 3 characteristics to estimate the capacity of each supplier.
*Selected the top 50 suppliers, and further applied multi-objective programming to deduce at least 13 necessary suppliers based on the enterprise’s goal and made detailed transportation plan.

**Study on Changes of Autophagy in Peripheral Blood of Patients with Progressive Cerebral Infarction**

* Collected and sorted data of progressive cerebral infarction (PCI) patients.
* Analyzed the danger factors of PCI group and NPCI group with Mann-Whitney U test.
* Used two-sample t-test to compare the mRNA expression amount of Beclin 1, LC3Ⅱand P62 between NPCI group and the control group.
* Adopted one-factor ANOVA to analyze the mRNA expression amount of Beclin 1, LC3Ⅱand P62 of PCI group, NPCI group and the control group.

### Skills 
* Technical Skills: R, Python, SPSS, Stata, GPower
